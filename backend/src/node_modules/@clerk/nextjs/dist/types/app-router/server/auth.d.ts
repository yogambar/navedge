     *
     * | Authenticated | Authorized | `auth.protect()` will |
     * | - | - | - |
     * | Yes | Yes | Return the [`Auth`](https://clerk.com/docs/references/backend/types/auth-object) object. |
     * | Yes | No | Return a `404` error. |
     * | No | No | Redirect the user to the sign-in page\*. |
     *
     * @important
     * \*For non-document requests, such as API requests, `auth.protect()` returns a `404` error to users who aren't authenticated.
     *
     * `auth.protect()` can be used to check if a user is authenticated or authorized to access certain parts of your application or even entire routes. See detailed examples in the [dedicated guide](https://clerk.com/docs/organizations/verify-user-permissions).
